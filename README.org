* About

This little extension to [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings][ido]] makes window commands such as
=ido-find-file-other-window=, =ido-switch-buffer-other-window=, and
others, obsolete.  It follows behavior similar to [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] window actions
upon selection.

This extension is adapted from the original [[https://gist.github.com/timcharper/493269][Gist]] by Tim Harper to be
shippable through MELPA.

* Usage

Just put =ido-other-window.el= somewhere in your Emacs =load-path=, then
load it after enabling =ido-mode=, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ido-mode +1)
(require 'ido-other-window)
#+END_SRC

Then, from an ido file or buffer selection, you can now do:

| =C-o= | open file/buffer in other window sensibly       |
| =C-2= | open file/buffer in a vertically-split window   |
| =C-3= | open file/buffer in a horizontally-split window |
| =C-4= | open file/buffer in other window (same as C-o)  |
| =C-5= | open file/buffer in a new frame                 |

=C-o= will try to use =split-window-preferred-function= if that is
defined, before falling back with =split-window-sensibly=.

* Tips and Tricks

One can define =split-window-preferred-function= to prefer side-by-side
window splitting, which may be useful on widescreen displays:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; cribbed from https://github.com/zakame/.emacs.d/commit/b550b7
(setq split-window-preferred-function
      '(lambda (window)
         "Split WINDOW, preferably side by side."
         (let ((split-height-threshold
                (and (< (window-width window)
                      split-width-threshold)
                   split-height-threshold)))
           (split-window-sensibly window))))
#+END_SRC
