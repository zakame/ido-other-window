* About

This little extension to ido[fn:1:
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings] makes window
commands such as =ido-find-file-other-window=,
=ido-switch-buffer-other-window=, and others, obsolete.  It follows
behavior similar to Helm[fn:2: https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm]
window actions upon selection.

This extension is adapted from the original Gist[fn:3:
https://gist.github.com/timcharper/493269] by Tim Harper to be shippable
through MELPA.

* Usage

Just put =ido-other-window.el= somewhere in your Emacs =load-path=, then
load it after enabling =ido-mode=, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ido-mode +1)
(require 'ido-other-window)
#+END_SRC
