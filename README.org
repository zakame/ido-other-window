* About

This little extension to [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings][ido]] makes window commands such as
=ido-find-file-other-window=, =ido-switch-buffer-other-window=, and
others, obsolete.  It follows behavior similar to [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] window actions
upon selection.

This extension is adapted from the original [[https://gist.github.com/timcharper/493269][Gist]] by Tim Harper to be
shippable through MELPA.

* Usage

Just put =ido-other-window.el= somewhere in your Emacs =load-path=, then
load it after enabling =ido-mode=, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ido-mode +1)
(require 'ido-other-window)
#+END_SRC
